# Zoo-keeper

##
The scenario: the local zoo has received funding to build a new online catalog, and they've asked me to create a web server for a front-end application they’re developing, called Zoo Keepr. This site’s data will be stored on the server I create. This will allow animal enthusiasts to access the data from different locations and browsers without needing to download it to their device.

##
* Set up and run a Node.js web server using Express.js
* Handle two types of GET requests using parameters
* Make the application production-ready and deploy it on Heroku
* Configure an Express.js back end to serve static HTML files.
* Configure an Express.js back end to create an API to handle GET and POST requests.
* Configure an Express.js app to serve static files.
* Identify how client-side requests relate to server-side responses.
* Parse optional and required parameters when creating server-side routes.
* Implement client-side POST requests to submit form data to a server.
* Implement separation of concerns for routing.
* Deploy a server-side application to the Heroku platform.
* Parse parameters in server-side routes.
* Submit form data to a server.
* Implement separation of concerns for routing.
* Deploy a server-side application to the Heroku platform.
* Created GET routes that serve HTML content instead of JSON.
* Implemented a special Express.js middleware function that helps serve front-end assets.
* Used front-end JavaScript to send data to our POST routes.
* Deepened your knowledge and revisited front-end GET functionality using the Fetch API.


###
By connecting the server I created, it will allow the front end to make AJAX requests to our server, much like i’ve done in the past with server-side APIs. The data that we use will be stored as a JSON. The zoo has already provided us with a JSON file containing their animals.

Node.js has built-in capabilities to create APIs, but Express.js makes it much easier to do so. It is also currently the industry standard, which makes it a very marketable technology to know.

###
This application functions with a web server using the Express.js framework, I then add it to a front-end application that the local zoo is developing, called Zoo Keepr. The site’s data lives on the server I built so that anyone can access it without having to download it.
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is considered the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

Express allows you to quickly and easily establish API routes and associated HTTP request methods.
The animal.html file allows users to see all of the animal data from our server.

These JavaScript files have all of the main functionality handled when it comes to capturing form data and printing it to the page.
By completing this web application I’ve expanded on my knowledge of modularizing applications and successfully separated the server logic from the routes.
Now I can confidently set up an Express.js server that serves HTML and JSON to a client.
